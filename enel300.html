            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>We learned about the <u>software development cycle</u> and <u>project management</u> in ENEL 300. If I
                had one takeaway from the class, it’d be that I gained valuable leadership and teamwork skills. Through
                the process of developing a product with my team, I learned about just how much communication a team
                needs to be successful. </p>
            <p>We also learned about the software development cycle using the <b>SCRUM framework</b>. We broke our
                project down into short sprints, which gave us much more flexibility. Due to the pandemic we had to
                change things as we went multiple times; the SCRUM framework made this easy to execute.</p>
            <p>A difficult aspect of this course was communicating with others in a way where they understand
                what exactly you’re talking about. I found that my teammates sometimes didn’t completely get what I was
                trying to express.</p>
            <p>Moving forward from these experiences I'm now able to more <u>clearly articulate</u> my thoughts and find
                mediums to do so whether it be verbally, visually, or by writing/typing. I can among other
                things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create clear task boards.</li>
                <li>Write user stories for a product.</li>
                <li>Keep track of work progress using methods such as burndown charts.</li>
                <li>Articulate my thoughts well at meetings.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
        <p>ENEL 300 taught me about entrepreneurship too. I’ve gained the skills to make an effective product targeted
            at a <u></u>specific user group</u> in order to make the <u>most profit</u>. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making pitches</li>
            <li>Marketing a product</li>
            <li>Looking at user personas</li>
            <li>Making value propositions</li>
            <li>Making a business plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’ve gotten used to putting myself in the shoes of the end users to develop <u>effective user stories</u> to
            guide product development. I’ve learned to make sure to target the things that users are interested in and
            to consider what might be going on in their lives to relieve pain points they might have.</p>
        <p>When giving pitches, I learned to deliver them with <u>confidence</u>, looking my audience in the eye as I
            describe the benefits of our product. It was a bit difficult to put myself out there and make pitches at
            first, but repeated presentations to our peers has allowed me to be more confident when talking about my
            products.</p>
        <p>The thing that stuck with me the most in this class was to always consider what the end users might want.
            It’s imperative that I put myself in their situation and respond to their feedback.</p>

        <div class="project__text">
            <h3>The Product</h3>
            <p>As part of my schooling, I participated in the University of Calgary's Integrated Learning Stream (ILS)
                for second year electrical engineers. In one of our ENEL 300 courses, we created a project called the TA
                (Temperature Alarm). The alarm alerts plant owners if the temperature of the area or moisture of the
                soil is unsuitable.</p>
            <p>The TA uses a PIC microcontroller as the brain of the product. The voltage output of a voltage divider
                circuit with a thermistor in it is taken as input into one of the pins of the microcontroller.
                Similarly, the microcontroller reads the voltage from a moisture detector.</p>
            <p>Math is done by the microcontroller to determine the temperature and moisture, which are both displayed
                to the screen via an LCD screen. If the temperature falls out of a range specified by the user, a signal
                is transmitted wirelessly to the alarm unit, alerting the user. For the moisture, the alarm will go off
                when the soil becomes too dry.</p>
        </div>

            <p>Our product had multiple iterations. The initial ideas included a sign language to speech converter, a
                morse code to speech converter, and a remote forest fire alarm. We had to change these ideas because
                they weren’t feasible with our knowledge as second year engineers and due to the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Our final product started off as a simple temperature alarm. We changed the idea to become wireless for
                convenience, and added a moisture sensor to gear it towards plant owners. Our reasoning was that the
                multifunctionality would be attractive to consumers and that there was a bigger potential market with
                the use for plants. There were contingency plans for the product, which was to develop an app to connect
                the temperature sensor to your phone.</p>

            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
            <p>The product we developed didn’t come without challenges. Working with a team and implementing the SCRUM
                framework for the first time had some rough patches. It was difficult for us to take initiative and
                develop ideas that were feasible for us to pull off considering the pandemic.</p>
            <p>The most difficult aspect of the project was working on a technical product remotely. It was hard for us
                to work together on a product when we didn’t have the physical product to look at together. We overcame
                this meeting frequently online and by focusing on the software aspect of the product.</p>
            <p>What I found especially rewarding was how our team was able to get together to push out a design for a
                product despite working virtually. Although we weren’t able to get a physical product together, it was
                gratifying having a solid design ready. The ability to <u>communicate</u> virtually with others is an
                asset that will continue to help me move forward; it was truly making lemonade out of lemons.</p>

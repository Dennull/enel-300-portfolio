            <h3>The Product</h3>
            <p>As part of my schooling, I participated in the University of Calgary's Integrated Learning Stream (ILS)
                for second year electrical engineers. In one of our ENEL 300 courses, we created a product called the TA
                (Temperature Alarm). The alarm alerts plant owners if the temperature of the area or moisture of the
                soil is unsuitable.</p>
            <p>The TA uses a PIC microcontroller as the brain of the product. The output of a voltage divider circuit
                with a thermistor in it is taken as input into one of the pins of the microcontroller. Similarly, the
                microcontroller reads the voltage from a moisture detector.</p>
            <p>The microcontroller determines the temperature and moisture, which are both displayed to the screen via
                an LCD screen. If the temperature falls out of a range specified by the user, a signal is transmitted
                wirelessly to the alarm unit, alerting the user. For the moisture, the alarm will go off when the soil
                becomes too dry.</p>
        </div>
        <img class="project__img" src="images/3d-ta-model.png" alt="Model of the TA">
        <div class="project__text">
            <p>Our final product started off as a simple temperature alarm. We changed the idea to become wireless for
                convenience, and added a moisture sensor to gear it towards plant owners. Our reasoning was that the
                multifunctionality would be attractive to consumers and that there was a bigger potential market with
                the use for plants. There were contingency plans for the product, which was to develop an app to connect
                the temperature sensor to your phone.</p>
            <p>Using an <b>iterative method</b> made it easy for us to modify the product. Following the <b>SCRUM
                    framework</b>, we divided the work up into sprints. The team would meet often for updates and review
                our product at the end of every sprint to make the appropriate changes.</p>

            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
            <p>The product we developed didn’t come without challenges. Working with a team and implementing the SCRUM
                framework for the first time had some rough patches. It was difficult for us to take initiative and
                develop ideas that were feasible for us to pull off considering the pandemic.</p>
            <p>The most difficult aspect of the project was working on a technical product remotely. It was hard for us
                to work on a product when we didn’t have the physical product to look at together. We overcame this
                meeting frequently online and by focusing on the software aspect of the product.</p>
            <p>What I found especially rewarding was how our team was able to get together to push out a design for a
                product despite working virtually. The ability to <b>communicate</b> virtually with others is an asset
                that will continue to help me move forward. I'm proud of our team for being <b>resourceful</b> with what
                we had; it was truly making lemonade out of lemons.</p>
